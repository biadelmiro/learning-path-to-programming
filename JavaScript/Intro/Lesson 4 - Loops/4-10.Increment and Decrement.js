x++ or ++x // same as x = x + 1
x-- or --x // same as x = x - 1
x += 3 // same as x = x + 3
x -= 6 // same as x = x - 6
x *= 2 // same as x = x * 2
x /= 5 // same as x = x / 5

NOTE:
++x and --x shows the result right after the increment.
x++ and x-- need to call the variable again to show the result.
