## Scope

The set of variables available for a given function to use _when it is run_ is called a **runtime scope**. The code inside of the function has access to:

* The function's arguments.
* Local variables declared within the function.
* Variables from its parent function's scope.
* Global variables.

Let's take a look at the following example:

```JavaScript
const a = 'a';

function parent() {
    const b ='b';

    function child() {
        const c = 'c';
    }
}
```

The inner function _child_ has access to all variables available on a outermost level of the scope. However, the parent function can't access its childs variables, and so on.

```JavaScript
function greet () {
    const greeting = 'Hello';

    function name() {
        const myName = 'Rafael';
        console.log(`${greeting}, ${myName}!`)
    }
    return name();
}
```

We don't need to pass in the variable `greeting` as an argument to `name()`, since it is child of `greet()`and has access to the parent variables.

_**Note**_: The return of the function must be a _function call_ `name()`, otherwise we would be just passing the function's name `name` as an argument without executing it, or calling the second function using `greet()()`.

**Function-Scoped**

In JavaScript, variable are traditionally defined in the scope of a function, rather than in the scope of a block. That's why JavaScript is function-scoped. Any variables defined inside of a function _scope_ is not available outside of that. Otherwise, if there are any variable defined inside of a _block_ (e.g. `if` statement), those are available outside of that block.

**Example**

```JavaScript
var globalNumber = 5;

function globalIncrementer() {
  const localNumber = 10;

  globalNumber += 1;
  return globalNumber;
}
```

Both `globalNumber` and `localNumber` are accessible by `globalIncrementer()`. However, `globalNumber` doesn't need declaration because it was declared in the global `window`, that is the outermost level.

If we try to acess `globalNumber` we will see its value

```JavaScript
window.globalNumber;
//5
```

But if we try to access `localNumber` we'll see an error:

```JavaScript
window.localNumber;
//ReferenceError: localNumber is not defined
```

This happens because `localNumber` is only accessible inside the scope of the function `globalIncrementer()`, and other functions inside of it.

>_ES6 syntax allows for additional scope while declaring variables with the **let** and **const** keywords. These keywords are used to declare block-scoped variables in JavaScript, and largely replace the need for var._

**Scope Chain**

Whenever the code attempts to access a variable during a function call, the JavaScript engine will start off from its own local variables. If it isn't found, it will continues looking up. This is defined as _scope chain_.

Let's see the example bellow:

```JS
function one() {
  two();
  function two() {
    three();
    function three() {
      // function three's code here
    }
  }
}

one();
```
When `one()` is called, all the other functions are called way down to `three()`, and then the code of that function is executed. If the variable isn't there, the interpreter will start looking up until it finds the variable. If it reaches the window (the outter most level), then `undefined` is returned.

**Shadowing**

JavaScript won't throw an error or prevent the creation of an extra variable. Instead, the variable with local scope will just temporarily "shadow" the variable in the outer scope. It means that the local variable will replace temporarily the outer scope variable.

```javascript
const symbol = 'Â¥';

function displayPrice(price) {
  const symbol = '$';
  console.log(symbol + price);
}

displayPrice('80');
// '$80'
```

What was before a 'Â¥' in `symbol`variable, was replace by a '$' in the local variable also called `symbol`. Since the code always is executed from the inside to outside, when Javascript finds that variable, it finishes the execution and never reaches the outer level.
