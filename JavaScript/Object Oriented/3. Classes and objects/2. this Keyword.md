## The `this` Keyword

The value of this is connected with functions and objects. When a functions is called, the value of _this_ is set to an specific object, whether this is a created object from a constructor function or object notation, a method invoked inside an object, or even a regular function call.

Let's take a closer look on what's happening in the following code bellow:

```JavaScript
function Clock() {
    this.hours = 10;
    this.minutes = 16;
    this.work = function() {
        console.log(`Tick! Tack! It's ${this.hours} hours and ${this.minutes} minutes.`)
    }
    this.rememberHour = function() {
        this.work();
    }
};

var clock = new Clock();

clock.work();
clock.rememberHour();

// Tick! Tack! It's 10 hours and 16 minutes.
// Tick! Tack! It's 10 hours and 16 minutes.
```

When invoking a constructor function with the `new` operator, `this` gets the value of the newly-created object (i.e. all its properties, values and methods). So, the _this_ keyword **refers to the object itself**, and we can access the object's properties. Then, when the method `work()` is invoked, what it really means is: "_get the value of the **key property hours** of **this object**, and the same for minutes, and so on_."

âš  If we wrote `work()` instead `this.work()` in `rememberHour()` the function would have look for a local variable called `work`, instead the method `work()` defined in _this_ object. If not found, it would continue to look up until reach the global environment. Since work is not defined, it will return an Uncaught ReferenceError: work is not defined.

The `this` keyword can be assigned in those three different ways as shown above, and in a fourth way that allows us to set its value by ourselves.

|Call Style     |`new`       |method       |function     |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
|value of `this`|{new object}|object itself|global object|
|Example        |new Clock() |clock.work() |myFun()      |

**Note:** `this` is an object that is part of the global window environment provided by the browser, and is not always assigned to the object where it is defined. In fact, the value of this is not assigned to anything until it is called by a method, regular function or the `new` operator.
